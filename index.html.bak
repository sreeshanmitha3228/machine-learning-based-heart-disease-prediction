		Abstract-Data mining, a great developing technique that
revolves around exploring and digging out significant information
from massive collection of data which can be further beneficial in
examining and drawing out patterns for making business related
decisions. Talking about the Medical domain, implementation of
data mining in this field can yield in discovering and withdrawing
valuable patterns and information which can prove beneficial in
performing clinical diagnosis. The research focuses on heart
disease diagnosis by considering previous data and information.
To achieve this SHDP (Smart Heart Disease Prediction) is built via
Navies Bayesian in order to predict risk factors concerning heart
disease.</p><p align="justify"><font size="3" style="font-family: Comic Sans MS" color='black'>The speedy advancement of technology has led to
remarkable rise in mobile health technology that being one of the
web application. The required data is assembled in a standardized
form. For predicting the chances of heart disease in a patient, the
following attributes are being fetched from the medical profiles,
these include: age, BP, cholesterol, sex, blood sugar etc... The
collected attributes acts as input for the Navies Bayesian
classification for predicting heart disease. The dataset utilized is
split into two sections, 80% dataset is utilized for training and rest
20% is utilized for testing.</p><p align="justify"><font size="3" style="font-family: Comic Sans MS" color='black'> The proposed approach includes
following stages: dataset collection, user registration and login
(Application based), classification via Navies Bayesian, prediction
and secure data transfer by employing AES (Advanced
Encryption Standard). Thereafter result is produced. The
research elaborates and presents multiple knowledge abstraction
techniques by making use of data mining methods which are
adopted for heart disease prediction. The output reveals that the
established diagnostic system effectively assists in predicting risk
factors concerning heart diseases.
